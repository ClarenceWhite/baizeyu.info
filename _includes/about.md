# About Me

-   I'm currently a full-stack developer, committed to bringing my creative visions to life through various technologies. I enjoy doing things my own way and value the spirit of pragmatism to turn possibilities into reality step by step. My interests range from writing amusing small programs out of boredom to seriously tackling real-world problems using diverse technologies. To me, each day is about "playing." I'm constantly on the lookout for challenges that keep me engaged and happy, even if they are difficult or stressful.

-   I've held a wide variety of unrelated jobs. While this might seem like a lack of planning to others, I adapt quickly and take the essential skills from each role, applying them to new domains. My innate thought process involves quickly grasping the essence of something and following objective principles.

-   An avid reader, my tastes span philosophy, physics, biographies, math, chemistry, literature, and management. I read for 30-60 minutes each morning or evening, completing around 20 books a year. I also share my book notes here.

-   I'm passionate about music, especially rock and classical genres, because they can be both intense and graceful. You'll also find my music reviews here.

-   Obviously, I like to write. While I wrote poetry and balanced prose when I was younger, I now primarily write technical blogs and reflections, almost like a journal.

-   Ever since childhood, my keen eye for detail has allowed me to remember vivid scenes, even years later. I am more concerned with how to utilize tools to solve problems than fretting over syntax and commonly used APIs. This is an obsession; when faced with unresolved issues, I constantly think of solutions, disregarding everything else.

# Personal Experiences

## 1998-2010

-   Born and raised in a modest family in a poor mountainous area in China. Always a rebellious and playful child, I often got into mischief and even fights, which troubled my teachers and parents. However, I consistently performed well academically without any supervision. Strict and rigid teachers were met with my rebellious actions.

-   My love for knowledge once led me to sneak back into school during a flu outbreak, ending in tears when turned away by a teacher.

-   Around 2006, I got my first computer and became engrossed in various computer games, becoming seriously addicted from 2008-2010.

-   My happiest childhood memories were spent in the mountains, streams, and fields, where I observed various animals and plants up close.

## 2010-2016

-   Due to the pressures of China's educational system, I spent six years in a predominantly boarding school. My entertainment was limited to sports and reading, but my interest in diverse subjects flourished, despite not always understanding the complex material.

-   High school was enjoyable thanks to smart and diligent classmates who had a lasting influence on my values.

## 2016-2020

-   Wasted four years in a major I wasn't interested in, missing the opportunity to switch majors. However, these years were spent searching for my true passion.

-   First went abroad for a winter school in Cambridge in 2018, which had a profound impact on my future decisions and thought processes.

-   Managed an international aid project in late 2019, helping individuals from extremely impoverished countries and realizing the stark inequalities in the world.

## 2020-2021

-   Took a well-paying job during a gap year due to the pandemic, benefiting from large capital investments in China's online education industry. Acquired invaluable team management skills, which still benefit me today.

-   Left the industry just as the Chinese government started cracking down on capital flow in education.

## 2021-

-   Completed a Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Dublin.
