On Saturday, April 15th, I woke up early and went alone to the Great Sugar Loaf in Wicklow. I had never been to that mountain before, so I did not know the correct route to take up the mountain. However, I knew that the highest peak was my goal for the day, and I needed to find a way to reach it. After getting off the bus, I stood at the foot of the mountain and gazed up at the summit.

I did not have any guide or plan, but only saw a white line on Google Maps that seemed like a route to the summit. I assumed that it would be an easy pathway taken by everyone. However, I realized halfway up that the white line was actually a small stream flowing down from the peak. The route was full of water holes on the muddy ground covered by dense vegetation, with no clear path ahead. I felt lost and confused about how to proceed.

But when I looked up at the summit, I told myself that the journey up the mountain was like life's uncertainties. You never know if your choices will be difficult or simple, and what challenges you might face. However, I could see the summit, and that was where I needed to go. So, I put on some climbing music, focused on the destination, and searched for a path that would lead me towards my goal. I changed my target to a point 50 meters away from me, and aimed to reach there despite the obstacles in my way.

By setting small targets and concentrating on each step, I gradually shifted my attention from the pain to the present moment. After 50 minutes of exploration, I finally found the right path leading to the summit. I joyfully sprinted along the pathway, leaving behind all the hardships I had endured. When I reached another fork in the road, I was faced with two routes that led to the summit. One was an easy route with large rocks for stepping on, but it would take more time since it was not so steep. The other was a steeper route almost 80Â° angle, with no one else around to help if anything went wrong.

I chose the second path and rested for two minutes at the junction, took a deep breath and began climbing. I continued to set small goals for myself, focusing on reaching each point along the way. I climbed up step by step, without getting tired or discouraged. Finally, standing at the summit, I looked down at the beautiful coastline and marveled at my own abilities. I had achieved my goal through perseverance and determination.

After sitting at the summit for 20 minutes, I started on my journey back down. Once again, fate played a trick on me, and I found myself lost midway through the descent. However, this time my mindset had changed. I was no longer worried about whether I could get back down safely because I knew that I could. I had overcome the uncertainty of climbing up the mountain. Although I was on the wrong path, I still saw sights that others couldn't see and smelled the fragrance of April flowers that others couldn't smell.

As expected, after many twists and turns, I finally made it back to the bus stop. I was so exhausted that I fell asleep on the bus ride back. When I got off the bus, my legs were numb, and it took 100 meters of walking before I regained feeling in them.

This experience taught me that although some things in life can be certain, it is the unexpected uncertainties that are worth challenging ourselves with. Pursuing stability is encoded in human genes, but courage and action in the face of uncertainty are the treasures that bring vitality to our lives.
