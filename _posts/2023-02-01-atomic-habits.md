# About

A book by Clear James, one of the best-selling books.

# Notes

-   changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years .
-   The backbone of this book is my four - step model of habits — cue , craving , response , and reward — and the four laws of behavior change that evolve out of these steps .
-   “ The whole principle came from the idea that if you broke down everything you could think of that goes into riding a bike , and then improve it by 1 percent , you will get a significant increase when you put them all together . ”
-   Habits are the compound interest of self - improvement . The same way that money multiplies through compound interest , the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them . They seem to make little difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous . It is only when looking back two , five , or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent .
-   Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits . Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits . Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits . Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits . Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits . You get what you repeat .
-   Productivity compounds . Accomplishing one extra task is a small feat on any given day , but it counts for a lot over an entire career . The effect of automating an old task or mastering a new skill can be even greater . The more tasks you can handle without thinking , the more your brain is free to focus on other areas . Knowledge compounds . Learning one new idea won’t make you a genius , but a commitment to lifelong learning can be transformative . Furthermore , each book you read not only teaches you something new but also opens up different ways of thinking about old ideas . As Warren Buffett says , “ That’s how knowledge works . It builds up , like compound interest . ” Relationships compound . People reflect your behavior back to you . The more you help others , the more others want to help you . Being a little bit nicer in each interaction can result in a network of broad and strong connections over time .
-   THE PLATEAU OF LATENT POTENTIAL FIGURE 2 : We often expect progress to be linear . At the very least , we hope it will come quickly . In reality , the results of our efforts are often delayed . It is not until months or years later that we realize the true value of the previous work we have done . This can result in a “ valley of disappointment ” where people feel discouraged after putting in weeks or months of hard work without experiencing any results . However , this work was not wasted . It was simply being stored . It is not until much later that the full value of previous efforts is revealed .
-   Goals are about the results you want to achieve . Systems are about the processes that lead to those results .
-   If you want better results , then forget about setting goals . Focus on your system instead .
-   Goals are good for setting a direction , but systems are best for making progress .
-   Achieving a goal only changes your life for the moment . That’s the counterintuitive thing about improvement . We think we need to change our results , but the results are not the problem . What we really need to change are the systems that cause those results . When you solve problems at the results level , you only solve them temporarily . In order to improve for good , you need to solve problems at the systems level . Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves .
-   Finally , a goal - oriented mind - set can create a “ yo - yo ” effect . Many runners work hard for months , but as soon as they cross the finish line , they stop training . The race is no longer there to motivate them . When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal , what is left to push you forward after you achieve it ? This is why many people find themselves reverting to their old habits after accomplishing a goal . The purpose of setting goals is to win the game . The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game . True long - term thinking is goal - less thinking . It’s not about any single accomplishment . It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement . Ultimately , it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress .
-   Habits are the compound interest of self - improvement . Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long - run . Habits are a double - edged sword . They can work for you or against you , which is why understanding the details is essential . Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold . The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed . You need to be patient . An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system . Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules , atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results . If you want better results , then forget about setting goals . Focus on your system instead . You do not rise to the level of your goals . You fall to the level of your systems .
-   In this way , the process of building habits is actually the process of becoming yourself .
