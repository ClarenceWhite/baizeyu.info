I started my first day as a part-time teaching assistant today and also started seeking work in a foreign country for the first time. On the way home I randomly cycled through Dvorak's classics, my favourites being the second and fourth chapter, they are very different in style but both reflect the feeling of living far from home in a new land. All in all, this piece made my heart sing and resonated with me and I fell in love with it on the first listen.
