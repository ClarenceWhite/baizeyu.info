When we talk about goals or plans, the first thing that comes to mind is usually a to-do list or an organized timetable that includes what we will be doing during a certain period of time, like the picture below:

However, when you actually follow this type of table, you may end up disrupting the entire plan because you are unable to complete tasks within the designated time blocks. You might also easily become frustrated.

I prefer an objective-oriented approach to setting goals in daily life. In this way, time blocks are not fixed, and everything can be flexible. At the same time, goals can be reached without a sense of urgency but achievement. Let me show you an example:

Instead of saying, "**I am going to learn English from 9-10 am today, I will sit there and read/listen to the book, and I will start exactly at 9 and end at 10, then move on to the next task**", I would say, "**I am going to study chapters 1&2 of the material in the next 5 days. After that, I will have a short break and can start new interesting chapters based on the ideas I learned from the first two chapters. Once I have a big time block during the day, I will move a little bit forward to complete the small goal set for the week/day**". Of course, we can have multiple goals for a week or a month. By switching among them, we can achieve our goals without getting bored easily.

Therefore, setting small goals instead of "big plans" is a better way to stay motivated. The goal represents desire, and setting oneself a short-term goal and focusing on achieving it is actually the pursuit of conquering and satisfying desire.
